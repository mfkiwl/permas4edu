## Experimental setup


The test object is an aluminium plate ($$L=200$$ [mm], $$H=150$$ [mm], $$t=3$$ [mm]) that is supported by soft rubber bands.
The circular holes at the 4 corners are each offset inwards by 15 mm from the side edges and have a diameter of 5 mm.

## Measurement data

## Results

## Finite element model

A structured mesh was used herein. The finite element model consists of 10545 QUAD4 elements and 10896 nodes.

## Modal correlation

$$MAC(i,j) = \frac{ |x_i^H y_j|^2 }{(x_i^H x_i) (y_j^H y_j)}, \quad 0 \le MAC(i,j) \le 1$$

## Conclusions

## Requirements

PERMAS V20 is needed for the computation of the MAC matrix using complex modes from experimental modal analysis (EMA).

## PERMAS4EDU
### Goal: 
PERMAS4EDU (https://www.intes.de/edu) has essentially the same functionality as the commercial version of PERMAS. However, some limitations are introduced in the educational edition to prevent commercial usage. It is based on version 19 and available on Windows 10/11 and Linux, respectively. Therefore it is well suited for self-study and further training.

### Methods: 
Python, Computer-Aided Engineering, Structural Dynamics, High Performance Computing, Finite Elements, Laminated Composites, Modal Analysis, Contact Mechanics, Vibroacoustics, Nonlinear Vibration, Harmonic Balance Method, Buckling, Topology Optimization, Shape Optimization, Sampling, DOE, Rotor dynamics, Mesh Generation, PERMAS, VisPER

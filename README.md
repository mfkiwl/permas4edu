## PERMAS4EDU
### Goal 
PERMAS4EDU (https://www.intes.de/edu) has essentially the same functionality as the commercial version of PERMAS. However, some limitations are introduced in the educational edition to prevent commercial usage. It is based on version 19 and available on Windows 10/11 and Linux, respectively. Therefore it is well suited for self-study and further training. Currently, it is just a mirror of the former Researchgate project PERMAS4EDU. For all new examples (as of April 4th 2023) we would like to use the [module names](#modules) from PERMAS to improve the directory structure.

### Methods 
Python, Computer-Aided Engineering, Structural Dynamics, High Performance Computing, Finite Elements, Laminated Composites, Modal Analysis, Contact Mechanics, Vibroacoustics, Nonlinear Vibration, Harmonic Balance Method, Buckling, Topology Optimization, Shape Optimization, Sampling, DOE, Rotor dynamics, Mesh Generation, PERMAS, VisPER

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/permas4edu/permas4edu.git  
cd permas4edu  
Open index.html with your favourite browser  

### Replication of results

Install the free education edition of PERMAS.  
Launch PERMAS Control Center

### Introduction

VisPER (Visual PERMAS) is a GUI based model editor with Python (3.9.12) scripting for automation. 
It is used to complete finite element models for specific applications with PERMAS. 
To this end VisPER fills efficiently the gap between FE models generated by a standard mesher such as Medina and PERMAS models which are ready to run. 
VisPER can also be used for model verification and post-processing tasks.
A specific user interface greatly simplifies the modeling and hence increases the efficiency of the user. 
VisPER directly accesses the PERMAS data structures achieving an unmatched data consistency between graphical user interface and PERMAS. 
In the future, new functions in PERMAS will be supported by the preprocessing earlier than today.

### Introduction

Images of the viewer window can be saved using the Snapshots dialog bar.
To get the best results it is important to know what final resolution of image is needed. 
Higher image resolution does not always result in better images. 
The optimal image resolution has the same size in pixels as the display on which the image should be presented. 
Every interpolation means loss of image quality. For example, if you need to create snapshots for a slide presentation 
and the presentation will be shown using a beamer in FullHD resolution (1920x1080 pixel) and the image will cover 80% of the slide 
in each direction that means you want to take snapshots with an image resolution of about 1536x864 pixels. 
If you show the presentation on a 4k UHD beamer with an aspect ratio of 16:9 your display output may have 3840x2160 pixels, 
in this case the optimal image resolution would be 3072x1728 pixels if it covers 80% of the slide again.
